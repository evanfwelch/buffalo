# Agent Instructions

This file is the source of truth for coding-agent guidance in this repo.

## Testing
- Run all tests with `poetry run pytest`.
- Prefer pytest-style tests for new coverage (function-based tests, fixtures, and `assert`).
- unittest tests are allowed and are collected by pytest.

## Conventions
- Follow existing project style and structure.
- Keep changes minimal and focused.
- If unsure, ask before making broad refactors.
